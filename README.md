Product app web application in Spring MVC

=====================================================================================

Steps:

Project Setup:

1. Open your chosen IDE and create a new Java project named productcrudapp.
Maven: Choose "Maven" 
Project Structure: Organize your project with packages like productcrudapp.controller, productcrudapp.dao, and productcrudapp.model to store different components.
Dependencies:

2. Add necessary libraries to your project:
Spring MVC: Core framework for building web applications.
Hibernate: Object-relational mapping (ORM) tool for interacting with databases.
Other relevant libraries like MySQL connector.
Use Maven's pom.xml file to manage dependencies efficiently.
Model:

3. Create Product.java class to represent a product entity with attributes like id, name, description, etc.
Data Access Object (DAO):

4. Create ProductDao.java class to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on product data using Hibernate.
Define methods for saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting products from the database.
Controller:

5. Create MainController.java (or similar) to handle user requests:
Define methods for displaying product lists, adding new products, editing existing products, etc.
Interact with the ProductDao to access and manipulate product data.
User Interface (UI):

6. Create JSP pages (like index.jsp) for different views:
Display product lists with appropriate formatting.
Provide forms for adding and editing products.
Use Spring MVC tags and expressions to integrate data and presentation logic.
Deployment:

7. Configure Spring MVC in spring-servlet.xml to define beans and mappings.
Package your project into a WAR file for deployment to a web server like Tomcat.
